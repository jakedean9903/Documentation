# **Documentation**
## **Introduction**
This documentation will give you an overview of my Sum-Of-Numbers program. The Sum-Of-Numbers program was written in Java, so a Java compiler will be needed. 
### **Summary Of The Program**
This programs was written by Jacob Dupuis Â© 2021. This program adds up the sum of a positive integer. Example: The sum of 4 is 10.
